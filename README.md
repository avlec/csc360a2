## Assignment Assistance
No help was obtained from others. With the exception of some answers
for things like syntax and compiler issues found from existing posts
on stackoverflow.com, and some other tutorial websites.

## Compilation/Execution Instructions
Although I normally like to use cmake this assignment just uses a
Makefile. So to compile the program execute the command `make` from
the same directory as this file. And to run the program type
`./kapish` from the same directory as this file.
